What does the model achieve?
- Derives linear correlation between car age and prices
How should metrics be interpreted?
- P-value indicates significance of data based on a threshold of 0.05; in this case p-value is < 0.0001 which means the test statistics falls into rejection region and null hypothesis is to be rejected
- R-square indicates variability in data accounted for by the model; in this case r-square is 0.9121 which means that 91% of data variability in the data is explained by the model 
- Slope shows relationship between car age and prices for model in addition to intercept
What are appropriate use cases?
- correlating two variables that are expected to have a linear relationship
How is it implemented? 
- Minimizing residuals (difference between model and each data point)
What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- Doesn't include car make and model 
How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
- Car price is strongly correlated with car age, car price decreases with age
